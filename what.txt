A bug/issue with Chrome (and thus, Electron) is that CSS relative position 
does not work inside an SVG foreignObject.  This means that a code editor such 
as CodeMirror or Monaco can not be implemented in a SVG element.

This project looks at using the flex property on HTML <div> elements for parts 
of the app where SVG will not work.

First -
    A  * box *  the covers the entire browser window.
    Another box inside it that is movable.

Second -
    Two boxes (inside the "root" box that covers the entire browser window).
    Regard these two boxes as "containers".
    In one of the boxes - a "control" (a div with simple content).
    Drag the control from one container to the other.

Save as a commit - "first commit".

Created branch "redirect".

index.html now redirects to the page being worked on.  In the <head>
of index.html (for example) -

	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=http://localhost:3000/src/client/html/drag-1.html" />

    This is used in the split.js demos.
    

Scenarios -

    1 -
        Full screen (or a panel) split horizontally (or vertically).
        One side of the split is closed.
        Should result in the split going away and leaving the other
        side occupying the whole screen/panel.
        Should be able to reopen what was closed and restore the split
        to the begining/pre-closing state.

        Application - The side being opened/closed might be a properties
        or settings list.


size-1.html -
    Simple sizing (with the mouse) of a simple panel (a <div>).
