A bug/issue with Chrome (and thus, Electron) is that CSS relative position 
does not work inside an SVG foreignObject.  This means that a code editor such 
as CodeMirror or Monaco can not be implemented in a SVG element.

This project looks at using the flex property on HTML <div> elements for parts 
of the app where SVG will not work.

First -
    A  * box *  the covers the entire browser window.
    Another box inside it that is movable.

Second -
    Two boxes (inside the "root" box that covers the entire browser window).
    Regard these two boxes as "containers".
    In one of the boxes - a "control" (a div with simple content).
    Drag the control from one container to the other.

Save as a commit - "first commit".

Created branch "redirect".

index.html now redirects to the page being worked on.  In the <head>
of index.html (for example) -

	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=http://localhost:3000/src/client/html/drag-1.html" />
